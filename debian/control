Description: Moar is a pager.
 Moar is a pager. It reads and displays UTF-8 encoded text from files or
 pipelines.
 .
 moar is designed to just do the right thing without any configuration:
 .
 The intention is that Moar should be trivial to get into if you have
 previously been using Less.
 .
 Doing the right thing includes:
 .
  * Syntax highlight source code by default using Chroma
  * Search is incremental** / find-as-you-type just like in Emacs
  * Filtering is incremental: Press & to filter the input interactively
  * Search becomes case sensitive if you add any UPPER CASE characters
    to your search terms, just like in Emacs
  * Regexp search if your search string is a valid regexp
  * Snappy UI even on slow / large input by reading input in the
    background and using multi-threaded search
  * Supports displaying ANSI color coded texts
  * Supports UTF-8 input and output
  * Transparent decompression when viewing compressed text files 
    (.gz, .bz2, .xz, .zst, .zstd) or streams
  * The position in the file is always shown
  * Supports word wrapping (on actual word boundaries) if requested
    using --wrap or by pressing w
  * Follows output as long as you are on the last line like tail -f
  * Renders terminal hyperlinks properly
  * Mouse Scrolling works out of the box
